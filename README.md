### reconstruction of the plots

to recreate the plots in this repository, one need to run the notbooks ex7 or ex6   

Note that the plots from ex6 are created with some randomness, therefore an exact recreation is not possible.

### Code

in support.py you find all functions which are needed to perform PCA, MDS and Isomap as well as support functions for comparison of these methods all performed in ex7.ipynb

In isomap.py you find all functions to perform Isomap as well as the tuned isomap which is done in ex6.ipynb
